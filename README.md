# ConfigurationFiles
Run the install script inside the cloning directory to setup everything NixOS related.

This will delete everything from .config directory so make a backup if you want to keep it.

To clone the repo including the submodule then make sure to run:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ElrohirGT/ConfigurationFiles.git
```
